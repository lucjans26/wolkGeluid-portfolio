## 1. Learning outcome
You acquire skills required for your future career. You are aware of multiple career paths and can reflect which ones fit best, considering your (potential) skills and ambitions. You are aware of developments in software engineering and can signal trends. 

## 2. Internship Choice
For an internship to have a high chance of succeeding, it is important to choose a company and assignment interests me. Of course it is possible to have a successfull internship without this, but I do believe this having that type of a company and assignment brings out the best in a soon to be graduating engineer.

### 2.1 Sector Choice
I believe that choosing the right company starts at finding a sector that suits you. Luckily I have a really clear view of the sector that interests me; logistics and (passenger) transport! Being born and raised in a family taxi business, and having and uncle and grandfather having worked for years as international truck drivers, the sector of logistics and transportation was basically spoonfed to me.
After doing my internship at [RYSK-IT](https://www.rysk-it.net/) creating a routing API, and after that working on helping developing the next generation of passenger transport dispatching systems, I got my confirmation that this was what I liked doing and that this was the sector I wanted to stick to.

### 2.2 Company Choice
I first found out about [BAS](https://www.bastruckcenter.com/) through the family business. While working I ran into a Talent Acquisition Specialist from BAS. While talking about my study, she mentioned that BAS was looking for software engineers. I knew about BAS through my uncle, so I had a general idea about what they did and could make a guess about what they worked on themselves.
I did want to keep my options open so I did look around for other oppertunities, these included [Share Logistics](https://www.sharelogistics.com/), [Flitsmeister](https://www.flitsmeister.nl/) and [The Dutch Coding Company](https://dutchcodingcompany.com/). After having contact with most of the other companies, I eliminated companies that didn't really match my tech stack. That left me with some 3 or 4 companies.
Having had interviews with 3 of the 4 companies, I decided that BAS was the company that matched my "work style" the most. I did have to make the choice to somewhat shift in my technology stack, but this seemed like an exciting change and challange.
Bonus points are for having heard from multiple people that BAS is an interesting and fun company to work for!
