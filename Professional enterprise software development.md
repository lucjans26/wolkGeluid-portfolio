## 1. Learning outcome
You develop and deploy enterprise software, both individually and as a team. You select a suitable enterprise development platform and application framework(s). You select and apply a software development process, which complies with professional industry standards. You actively share knowledge within your team and with stakeholders to improve knowledge & processes.

## 2. Peer Feedback
Peer feedback can be an effective way to validate the learning outcome because it allows for the evaluation of my skills and knowledge by students going through a similar learning experience. Furthermore it allows the other students to share their thoughts about me on a "personal" level and how enjoyable it is to work with me.

To make this chapter as concise as possible I will be summarising the feedback of all the group members into a single story.

### 2.1 Feedback Moment 1
_Disclaimer: due to the lighthearted nature of our group, many of the memebers did not take the first peer feedback moments as serious as they should have_

Luc is a good group member. He completes the tasks he is assigned to and tries to take the lead when necessary. Luc clearly knows what the project is about and has good ideas about it. Sometimes it might make sense to look at alternatives when you get stuck.

### 2.1 Feedback Moment 2
Luc clearly leads the group and is really strong analytically. He is great at making overall plannings and this helps the group keep on working. It's clear what Luc is working on and this shows during the presentations. Luc is really strong at giving presentations and this comes really natural to him. Furthermore Luc makes for a really good atmosphere witing the group.

## 3. Feedpulse
Feedback moments documented in feedpulse can also help to validate the learning outcome because they provide regular opportunities for me to reflect on my own progress and to receive feedback from teachers on my skills and knowledge. This makes it possible to identify areas for improvement and get support where necessary.

## 4. Reflection
I believe that I have made significant progress as a professional software developer on a technical level as well as on a personal level.
At the start of the semester I found it difficult to process feedback because it sometimes felt as if it was personal. This mostly came down to the amount of feedback and the ffact that is come down to the small things at first. After A while I started to seperate the teachers as people from the feedback they were giving me as professionals. This in turn made it a lot easier to process feedback and not feel attacked on a personal level.
Furthermore I have pushed myself to learn new technologies and concepts by myself (Python, Azure DevOps, Kubernetes, MongoDB, etc.), as well as in a team (Cassandra, Python, Spring). Besides this, I have also learned to hone skills and concepts I already knew about (RabbitMQ, Messaging in laravel, E2E testing, and more).

On a group level I believe we have produces a good project overall. Even though it might not be anything special on a technical level, it is on a professional level. I have learnt how important it is to prepare presentations for stakeholders. Even though the presentations might have hit some speed bumps along the way, I believe that we gave good presentations that sent great messages to the stakeholders (deliverables, burndown charts, design choices).
Furthermore I've had a great experience using Jira and working with SCRUM. Our deliverables and planning were always clear and tasks were always assigned making it someones responsibility, making sure it had to be completed.

I wholeheartedly believe that the skills I have learned and other skills I have mastered this semester, on a professional level as well as on a technical level, will be really valueable during my final internship and rest of my career

Addendum: "Ik denk dat jij meer gericht bent op optimalisatie van het proces en ook veel meer diepgang kan brengen in de feedback dan de overige studenten. Dat is een mooie eigenschap die ik niet vaak terug zie bij FH ICT studenten. Kort samengevat denk ik dus dat jij iets kan wat andere studenten niet zomaar kunnen. De andere studenten hebben volgens mij wel hun best gedaan maar komen niet verder als de feedback die ze hebben gegeven. Ben blij met deze mooie eigenschap." - _Monique Vissers **as a response to the meager 1st peer feedback from the group towards me**_
