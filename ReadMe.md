## 2. Document purpose
This document will share the road through semester 6 and the professional products I create and to what learning outcome these can be linked. For seperate learning events on certain topics seperate files will be created to share the progress through a certain topic.

## 3. Introduction
My name is Luc Janssen and I'm a student in Software engineering on Fontys Eindhoven. Besides this I am also currently working as a Software Engineer for [RYSK-IT](https://www.rysk-it.net/). After my orienting internship I found out that my true passion in the field is creating back-end systems. I hope to learn a lot more about the enterprise side of this in the current semester.

During the spring of 2021 I did my first internship at RYSK-IT. Just like most other students I found that it was quite hard to find my place and how to educate myself on certain topics. However I do think that this is where I leaned the most. Due to the small size of the company I was forced to learn a lot myself with only global pointers from the mentor. After finishing the internship, the company was so statisfied with my work that they offered me to continue working together and offered me a job and I decided to stay.

In this final year of my study I have set clear goals for what I want to achieve.
First of all I want to finish semester 6 as good as possible. Where I have barely sucessfully finished some prior semesters, I want to break this cycle to prove to myselft that a good work ethic really pays off. I don't have my eyes set on a certain company for my final internship, but I hope I will in the forseeable future.

## 4. Experience

## 5. Projects
Throughout this semester we are working on different projects. On one side we are working on a group project. Our group consists of 4 software students with vastly different skill sets. This is a project to learn about research and technology within a group. 
Besides this we are working on an individual project. This gives us the oppertunity to focus more explicitly on specific learning outcomes.

### 5.2 Group
The tax office is a government body that is responsible for levying and collecting taxes and customs duties for the state.

Within the country, a problem of traffic jams has arisen over the years that does not seem to be resolving itself. For this reason, the state has determined that road pricing can be used to reduce congestion on the road network. The state hopes to accomplish this by passing on congestion costs down to the driver and thereby making a driver think better about the use of a vehicle. This variable charging method makes it possible to charge different rates in certain areas or certain hours in order to be able to guide traffic to some extent.

## 6. Self Reflection
In this chapter I reflect on my own skill levels. Underneath is a table with the given learning outcomes plotted against what skill level i think i have myself on that outcome. Under de table you will find a briefly described explaination per learning outcome
