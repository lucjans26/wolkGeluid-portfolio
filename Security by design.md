## 1. Learning outcome
You investigate how to minimize security risks for your application, and you incorporate best practices in your whole software development process. 

## 2. Sonarcube 
To be implemented

## 3. Sonarlint
From the start of my development process, my IDE (phpStorm) has been equipped with [Sonarlint](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/). This free and open source extension helps identify and fix quality and security issues in real time during development. This makes sure that code is written cleanly and securely from the start and prevents having to change major issues in the future after a full scan. Besides just pointing out errors, it also explains why certain issues are issues in the first place so these can be avoided in the future.

## 4. Owasp top 10
The OWASP top 10 is a standard document that serves the purpose of creating awareness about the 10 most critical security issues in web applications. I created my own version of the document elaborating on what certain issues mean and how I (plan to) mitigate them.
